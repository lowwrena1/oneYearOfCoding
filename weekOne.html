        <h1>Day 1!</h1>
        <pre>Today I created html pages for both the very first page of this site and for this weeks work. 
I commented on the index.html page what I would like to create a side navbar to display each 
weeks work as well as screen shots and a blog post about each piece of the work.

of inception I created two styling sheets. The first one is a regular style sheet of css and the second
is a reset styling sheet that I have made in the past in use for all my coding projects.</pre>
